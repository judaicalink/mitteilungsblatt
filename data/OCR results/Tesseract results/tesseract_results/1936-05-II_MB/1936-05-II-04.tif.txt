SUN LIFE ASSURANCE COMPANY OF CANADA

Reflects the Strength and Stability of Life Assurance

A voluntary co-operative enterprise which for generations has stood every test

HIG ‏ד ו וו‎ UF

ASSURANCES IN FORCE... Exceed Five Hundred and Sixty-
two Million Pounds. This is the amount which will be paid by
the Sun Life as the policies now in force reach maturity. By
thrift and foresight more than a million policyholders have
provided, through Sun Life policies, for the support of
their families in case of premature death and their own
independence should they live to old age.

NEW ASSURANCES PAID FOR.. Exceed Forty-five
Million Pounds for the year. During 1935 more than
seventy thousand persons established estates by pur-
chasing Sun Life policies, thus providing security for
many thousands of homes.

POLICYHOLDERS AND BENEFICIARIES.. Benefits
amounting to Sixteen Million Pounds were paid out—over
Fifty-nine Thousand Pounds, for each working day. Since
the Sun Life commenced business 65 years ago, it has paid
out to policyholders and beneficiaries well over Two
Hundred Million Pounds.

ASSETS... Of over One Hundred and Forty-five Million Pounds
ensure that every Sun Life policy will be settled promptly
when the time for payment arrives. In the meantime,
this fund, invested on behalf of policyholders, contributes
notably to their benefit.
